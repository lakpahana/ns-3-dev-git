# WiFi Channel Proxy Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully created a YansWifiChannelProxy that intercepts and logs all method calls made to a WiFi channel. This is the foundation for implementing MPI-based distributed simulation in ns-3.

## What We've Implemented

### 1. YansWifiChannelProxy Class
- **Location**: `src/wifi/mpi-channel/yans-wifi-channel-proxy.h/cc`
- **Purpose**: A proxy class that wraps a YansWifiChannel and logs all method invocations
- **Inheritance**: Inherits from `Channel` (not `YansWifiChannel` due to non-virtual methods)

## Why We Didn't Inherit from YansWifiChannel

The key issue is that **most methods in YansWifiChannel are NOT virtual**, which means we cannot override them. 

### ‚ùå **What DOESN'T Work (Inheritance)**

```cpp
// This approach FAILS because Add() is not virtual in YansWifiChannel
class BadProxy : public YansWifiChannel {
public:
    void Add(Ptr<YansWifiPhy> phy) override {  // COMPILER ERROR!
        std::cout << "My logging code";        // This will NEVER execute
        YansWifiChannel::Add(phy);
    }
};

// When used:
Ptr<YansWifiChannel> channel = CreateObject<BadProxy>();
channel->Add(phy);  // Goes directly to YansWifiChannel::Add, NOT BadProxy::Add!
```

**Why it fails:**
1. `Add()`, `Send()`, `SetPropagationLossModel()` are **NOT virtual** in YansWifiChannel
2. You **cannot override non-virtual methods** in C++
3. Even if you could compile it, the calls would bypass your proxy code
4. You get **zero visibility** into channel operations

### ‚úÖ **What WORKS (Composition)**

```cpp
// This approach WORKS because we create our own methods
class GoodProxy : public Channel {
private:
    Ptr<YansWifiChannel> m_realChannel;  // Wrap the real channel
    
public:
    void Add(Ptr<YansWifiPhy> phy) {     // Our own method (not override)
        std::cout << "My logging code";   // This WILL execute
        m_realChannel->Add(phy);          // Delegate to real channel
    }
};

// When used:
Ptr<GoodProxy> proxy = CreateObject<GoodProxy>();
proxy->Add(phy);  // Calls OUR method, logging works perfectly!
```

**Why it works:**
1. We create **our own `Add()` method** (not trying to override)
2. We **wrap** a real YansWifiChannel instance
3. We **delegate** all calls to the real channel after logging
4. We get **full visibility** and control over all operations

### üß™ **Test It Yourself**

To see this problem in action, try compiling this code:

```cpp
// This WON'T compile!
class TestProxy : public YansWifiChannel {
public:
    void Add(Ptr<YansWifiPhy> phy) override {  // ERROR: cannot override non-virtual
        // Your code here
    }
};
```

The compiler will give you an error like:
```
error: 'void TestProxy::Add(...)' marked 'override', but does not override
```

### 2. Key Features
- **Method Logging**: All method calls are logged with:
  - Method name
  - Call parameters 
  - Call count
  - Simulation time
  - Detailed information about PHYs, devices, and nodes

- **Methods Tracked**:
  - `Add(Ptr<YansWifiPhy> phy)` - Adding PHYs to the channel
  - `Send(...)` - Packet transmission (ready for MPI implementation)
  - `SetPropagationLossModel(...)` - Propagation model configuration
  - `SetPropagationDelayModel(...)` - Delay model configuration
  - `GetNDevices()` - Device count queries
  - `GetDevice(index)` - Device retrieval
  - `AssignStreams(...)` - Stream assignment

### 3. Test Examples
- **Basic Test**: `wifi-channel-proxy-test.cc` - Demonstrates basic proxy functionality
- **Advanced Test**: `wifi-channel-proxy-advanced-test.cc` - Shows proxy with multiple nodes

## Sample Output

```
=== WiFi Channel Proxy Test ===
[YansWifiChannelProxy] PROXY_CALL: Constructor [SimTime: 0.000000s]
[YansWifiChannelProxy] PROXY_CALL: SetPropagationLossModel - Model: ns3::PropagationLossModel [SimTime: 0.000000s]
[YansWifiChannelProxy] PROXY_CALL: Add - Call #1, PHY: NodeId: 1, Channel: 1, Frequency: 2412.000000 [SimTime: 0.000000s]
[YansWifiChannelProxy] PROXY_CALL: Add - PHY added successfully. Total devices: 1 [SimTime: 0.000000s]
```

## Next Steps for MPI Implementation

Now that we have the proxy infrastructure with logging, the next steps would be:

1. **Replace logging with MPI calls**: Convert the logged method calls into MPI message-passing
2. **Implement serialization**: Add packet and parameter serialization for MPI transmission
3. **Create remote stubs**: Implement remote PHY stubs that run on the channel rank
4. **Add time synchronization**: Integrate with ns-3's MPI time management

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Non-intrusive**: The proxy approach doesn't modify existing ns-3 WiFi code
- **Observable**: All channel interactions are clearly logged and traceable
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new functionality or modify behavior
- **Debuggable**: Perfect for understanding WiFi channel communication patterns

## How to Run

```bash
# Build the project
./ns3 configure --build-profile=debug --enable-logs --enable-examples
./ns3 build

# Run the basic test
./ns3 run wifi-channel-proxy-test

# Run the advanced test
./ns3 run wifi-channel-proxy-advanced-test
```

The proxy successfully demonstrates that we can intercept all WiFi channel operations, which is exactly what we need before implementing the MPI functionality.
